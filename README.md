# Big Integer Library

The Big Integer Library is a C++ class, which provides the ability to do large integer arithmetic.
## Features

- Operator Overloading
    - All the __Operators__ are overloaded to make things simpler and easier.

            +  -  *  /  %  &  ^
            |  ~  >>  <<  ++  --
    - Operators for ___iostream___ are also overloaded which helps in easy __Input/Ouput__.

            Integer integer;
            cin >> integer;
            cout << integer;
- All Arithmetic Operations
    - Addition
    - Subtraction
    - Multication
    - Division & Modulo
- Any Radix/Base Conversion
- Random Integer Generation
- Bitwise Operations
    - AND i.e. "&"
    - OR i.e. "|"
    - XOR i.e. "^"
    - Left Shift i.e. "<<"
    - Right Shift i.e. ">>"
    - Compliment i.e. "~"
    - set_bit
    - unset_bit
